# Microsoft @ JSConf EU: LED Guide

At the Microsoft Booth this year, we're doing something extra special: an attendee-controlled LED build.

In this guide, we're going to go over the various parts you'll need to know (and extras you may _want_ to know) to control the LED build yourself!

## Overview

At the Microsoft booth, we'll have a rather unique setup: a programmable LED build that is controlled entirely by input received from JavaScript via [Azure Functions][azure-functions-docs].

Attendees can submit their own light patterns that will be queued up and run on the LED build. We welcome and encourage creative submissions, and are very much looking forward to seeing what you'll be able to do with the LED build.

Here are various the key things you'll want to know about if you're interested in submitting your own LED builds:

- Azure Functions
  - The Functions as a Service (a.k.a. Serverless) tool available from Azure
  - Check out [Creating and Deploying Azure Functions][creating-and-deploying-azure-functions] for more information on getting started!
- [rvl-node-animations][rvl-node-animations-npm]
  - The module by [Bryan Hughes][nebrius-twitter] that makes the interface for controlling lights in the LED build significantly more simple than hardcoding LED patterns.
  - Can be installed via `npm i rvl-node-animations`.
- [Submissions][submit-and-queue]
  - The page where you can submit your Azure Functions for the LED Build

## Global Prerequisites

Since this project relies on Azure, you'll need an Azure account. If you don't already have an Azure account, you can sign up for a free one [here](use-azure). With a free account, you get 1,000,000 Azure Functions executions per month.

Additionally, we're going to be working from a directory that I recommend you create now: `jsconf-eu-led`. Most, if not all, work we do will be within this directory. Of course this isn't a requirement for all functions, but for the purpose of this guide it makes sense ðŸ˜‡

## Creating and Deploying Azure Functions

Let's dig into creating and deploying functions in three ways: via the CLIs, via VS Code, and via the Azure Portal.

### Creating and Deploying Functions Using Azure CLIs

If you're more of a CLI user than an IDE or Portal user, you can use two CLIs â€“ one for building and testing Functions locally, and one for deploying your functions up to Azure.

If you encounter any problems or have questions about the CLIs, feel free to approach team members at the booth and we'll be happy to help you ðŸ˜Š

#### Installing the CLIs

The CLIs we're going to use are `func` and `az`:

- You can find install instructions for `func` [here](func-install-instructions), also known as azure-functions-core-tools.
- You can find install instructions for `az` [here](az-install-instructions).

#### Initializing this Functions Project and Creating a New Function

With `func`, you have a few initialization options available to you:

`func init [directory]`: Initializes the _current directory_ if you don't pass `[directory]`as a Functions app. If you do pass `[directory]`, a new directory named as whatever you pass `[directory]` will be created and initialized as a git repo.

Azure Functions support a suite of languages, including JavaScript and TypeScript... which is what we assume most, if not all, of you will use.

![An example of running `func init` to build out a Node.js + JavaScript Azure Function](./img/func-init.png)

It's worth noting that this creates a virtually empty `package.json`. You can safely run `npm init` again if you want to use the interactive CLI for generating a `package.json`, or `npm init -y` to automatically accept all defaults suggested by the interactive CLI.

`func new`: Scaffolds out a new Azure Function in the current directory. You will be prompted to select a template â€“ for our purposes we're going to do an HTTP trigger (option `8`).

![An example of running `func new` to scaffold out an Azure Function.](./img/func-new.png)

There are a few flags you can pass to `func new` that may be of interest. You can pass `--name <function name>` will automatically skip the interactive name selection, and `--template "<trigger name>"` where you pass the name of the template (in our case, `HttpTrigger`) that you'd like to use.

To scaffold our function out, we can run:

```bash
func new --name led-trigger --template "HttpTrigger"
```

A new directory called `led-trigger` will be created, in which you'll find `function.json` and `index.js` â€“ the basic components for a JavaScript Azure Function.

### Local Development

The `func start` command is available to you, allowing you to run your functions locally without the need to deploy them to the Cloud to test them.

Since we're working with HTTTP Trigger functions, you'll be provided a URL that they can be accessed from - you can check what they return at this URL.

#### Setting up the Cloud and Deploying Functions

To deploy, you'll need the `az` CLI. Let's get the CLI set up + build out some Cloud infrastructure for you:

Run `az login` (be sure you have the `az` CLI [installed][az-install-instructions]). This will open up your default browser to an authentication page, where you should login with a Microsoft account that has Azure set up.

From there we're going to run a suite of commands to build out our cloud infrastructure:

- Run: `az group create --name jsconfEU --location westeurope`
  - This command creates a new Resource Group.
  - `az group create` is the command here, telling Azure to create a new Resource Group
  - `--name jsconfEU` is what we're going to call this Resource Group.
  - `--location westeurope` is telling Azure which region we want to host this Resource Group in. There are currently [54 regions][regions].
- Run: `az storage account create --name jsconfeustorage --location westeurope --resource-group jsconfEU --sku Standard_LRS`
  - This command creates a new storage account, which is where the code you're going to be running will be stored.
  - `az storage account create` is our command, telling Azure to create a new storage account.
  - `--name jsconfEUStorage` is passing the name of the storage account we want to create. In this case, we've selected `jsconfEUStorage` but this can be anything.
  - `--location westeurope` is telling Azure which region we want to host this Storage account in. Generally you'd want to have it in the same region as your Resource Group.
  - `--resource-group jsconfEU` is the Resource Group we want to attach this Storage account to. We want to have this be the same Resource Group as the one we created with the previous command.
  - `--sku Standard_LRS` is passing an identifier for â€“ in this case â€“ what kind of storage account we want to create. `Standard_LRS` represents Standard Locally Redundant Storage, which is the most basic form of Storage.
- Run: `az functionapp create --resource-group jsconfEU --consumption-plan-location westeurope \ --name jsconfeu-led --storage-account jsconfeustorage --runtime node`
  - This command tells Azure to create a Function App and connects it to the other two parts that we just built.
  - `az functionapp create` is our basic command, telling Azure to create a new Function App.
  - `--resource-group jsconfEU` is passing the resource group we want to set up this Function App in.
  - `--consumption-plan-location westeurope` sets up the Function App as consumption-based in the same region as our other resources
  - `--name jsconfeu-led` is the name of our Function App as it appears in Azure.
  - `--storage-account jsconfeustorage` connects the Function App to the Storage account that we created.
  - `--runtime node` tells the Function App that it's going to be a JavaScript Function App.
- Finally, run: `func azure functionapp publish jsconfeu-led`
  - Here, we're using the `func` CLI to publish to a Function App called `jsconfeu-led`, which is what we named the Function App we created in the previous step.

### Creating and Deploying Functions Using VS Code

#### Installing the Tools

For development in VS Code, you'll want both the Azure Functions Core Tools CLI, and the Azure Functions extension for VS Code. You can find instructions on how to get both set up for your environment, there's an excellent in the the [VS Code docs][install-vs-code-reqs].

> If you have any questions about or issues with the getting the VS Code tools set up, feel free to ask anyone staffing the Microsoft booth â€“ we'd be happy to help âœ¨

Once you've got the CLI and extensions installed, you'll need to sign in to Azure. You can accomplish this by opening the Command Palette and typing `Azure: Sign In`:

![Screenshot of the VS Code Command Palette displaying the `Azure: Sign in` option](img/azure-sign-in.png)

Additionally, you can open up the Azure Functions sidebar and click "Sign in to Azure..." to sign in. To get the sidebar to appear you may need to restart VS Code.

Once installed and signed in, you should be ready to start running and deploying functions!

#### Local Development

In VS Code, you have two options for local Function development:

- `func start` uses the Azure Functions Core Tools CLI, and is an easy way to kick off your functions from the integrated terminal inside of VS Code. Ensure the current working directory is the directory your functions are in.
- Pressing the `F5` key inside of VS Code automatically runs your functions, since you have the Azure Functions extension.

Since we're working with HTTTP Trigger functions, you'll be provided a URL that they can be accessed from - you can check what they return at this URL.

#### Setting up the Cloud and Deploying Functions

With this directory open, you're going to want to start the function (Run `func start` in your terminal or press`F5`)
