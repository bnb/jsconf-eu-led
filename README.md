# Microsoft @ JSConf EU: LED Guide

At the Microsoft Booth this year, we're doing something extra special: an attendee-controlled LED build.

In this guide, we're going to go over the various parts you'll need to know (and extras you may _want_ to know) to control the LED build yourself!

## Table of Contents

- <TBD>

## Overview

At the Microsoft booth, we'll have a rather unique setup: a programmable LED build that is controlled entirely by input received from JavaScript via [Azure Functions][azure-functions-docs].

Attendees can submit their own light patterns that will be queued up and run on the LED build. We welcome and encourage creative submissions, and are very much looking forward to seeing what you'll be able to do with the LED build.

Here are various the key things you'll want to know about if you're interested in submitting your own LED builds:

- Azure Functions
  - The Functions as a Service (a.k.a. Serverless) tool available from Azure
  - Check out [Creating and Deploying Azure Functions][creating-and-deploying-azure-functions] for more information on getting started!
- [rvl-node-animations][rvl-node-animations-npm]
  - The module by [Bryan Hughes][nebrius-twitter] that makes the interface for controlling lights in the LED build significantly more simple than hardcoding LED patterns.
  - Can be installed via `npm i rvl-node-animations`.
- [Submissions][submit-and-queue]
  - The page where you can submit your Azure Functions for the LED Build

## Global Prerequisites

Since this project relies on Azure, you'll need an Azure account. If you don't already have an Azure account, you can sign up for a free one [here](use-azure). With a free account, you get 1,000,000 Azure Functions executions per month.

Additionally, we're going to be working from a directory that I recommend you create now: `jsconf-eu-led`. Most, if not all, work we do will be within this directory. Of course this isn't a requirement for all functions, but for the purpose of this guide it makes sense üòá

## Auzre Functions In This Repository

This repository contains a starter function that will work with the in-person demo that we'll have at JSConf EU. With some customization from you, you should be able to get you own color visualization up and running while at the conference by simply cloning this repo, making your tweaks, and shipping them to Azure.

Let's quickly dig into what's contained within this repo:

- `./LEDTrigger/` is a directory that contains all the setup needed for an Auzre Function, mostly contained within `function.json`, and JavaScript that we want to run as a part of our Function.
- `host.json` is a simple config file that tells Azure Functions how to configure itself.
- `package.json` is our JavaScript manifest that provides some details about our app to Azure Functions and exposes dependencies to npm as requirements for the project.

To get the function set up, you'll want to run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install our single direct dependency, [rvl-node-animations][rvl-node-animations-npm], which the Azure Function uses by default.

From there, you're going to want to run your functions to test them and then deploy them to the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è to submit them!

### The Tools You'll Need

#### Working from the CLI

- You can find install instructions for `func` [here](func-install-instructions), also known as azure-functions-core-tools.
- You can find install instructions for `az` [here](az-install-instructions).

#### Working from VS Code

For development in VS Code, you'll want both the Azure Functions Core Tools CLI, and the Azure Functions extension for VS Code. You can find instructions on how to get both set up for your environment, there's an excellent in the the [VS Code docs][install-vs-code-reqs].

> If you have any questions about or issues with the getting the VS Code tools set up, feel free to ask anyone staffing the Microsoft booth ‚Äì we'd be happy to help ‚ú®

Once you've got the CLI and extensions installed, you'll need to sign in to Azure. You can accomplish this by opening the Command Palette and typing `Azure: Sign In`:

![Screenshot of the VS Code Command Palette displaying the `Azure: Sign in` option](img/azure-sign-in.png)

Additionally, you can open up the Azure Functions sidebar and click "Sign in to Azure..." to sign in. To get the sidebar to appear you may need to restart VS Code.

### Developing Your LED Patterns with Azure Functions Locally

#### Local Development from the CLI

The `func start` command is available to you, allowing you to run your functions locally without the need to deploy them to the Cloud to test them.

Since we're working with HTTTP Trigger functions, you'll be provided a URL that they can be accessed from - you can check what they return at this URL.

#### Local Development from VS Code

In VS Code, you have two options for local Function development:

- `func start` uses the Azure Functions Core Tools CLI, and is an easy way to kick off your functions from the integrated terminal inside of VS Code. Ensure the current working directory is the directory your functions are in.
- Pressing the `F5` key inside of VS Code automatically runs your functions, since you have the Azure Functions extension.

Since we're working with HTTTP Trigger functions, you'll be provided a URL that they can be accessed from - you can check what they return at this URL.

## Deploying to the Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è

#### Building Infrastructure and Deploying from the CLI

To deploy, you'll need the `az` CLI. Let's get the CLI set up + build out some Cloud infrastructure for you:

Run `az login` (be sure you have the `az` CLI [installed][az-install-instructions]). This will open up your default browser to an authentication page, where you should login with a Microsoft account that has Azure set up.

From there we're going to run a suite of commands to build out our cloud infrastructure:

- Run: `az group create --name jsconfEU --location westeurope`
  - This command creates a new Resource Group.
  - `az group create` is the command here, telling Azure to create a new Resource Group
  - `--name jsconfEU` is what we're going to call this Resource Group.
  - `--location westeurope` is telling Azure which region we want to host this Resource Group in. There are currently [54 regions][regions].
- Run: `az storage account create --name jsconfeustorage --location westeurope --resource-group jsconfEU --sku Standard_LRS`
  - This command creates a new storage account, which is where the code you're going to be running will be stored.
  - `az storage account create` is our command, telling Azure to create a new storage account.
  - `--name jsconfEUStorage` is passing the name of the storage account we want to create. In this case, we've selected `jsconfEUStorage` but this can be anything.
  - `--location westeurope` is telling Azure which region we want to host this Storage account in. Generally you'd want to have it in the same region as your Resource Group.
  - `--resource-group jsconfEU` is the Resource Group we want to attach this Storage account to. We want to have this be the same Resource Group as the one we created with the previous command.
  - `--sku Standard_LRS` is passing an identifier for ‚Äì in this case ‚Äì what kind of storage account we want to create. `Standard_LRS` represents Standard Locally Redundant Storage, which is the most basic form of Storage.
- Run: `az functionapp create --resource-group jsconfEU --consumption-plan-location westeurope \ --name jsconfeu-led --storage-account jsconfeustorage --runtime node`
  - This command tells Azure to create a Function App and connects it to the other two parts that we just built.
  - `az functionapp create` is our basic command, telling Azure to create a new Function App.
  - `--resource-group jsconfEU` is passing the resource group we want to set up this Function App in.
  - `--consumption-plan-location westeurope` sets up the Function App as consumption-based in the same region as our other resources
  - `--name jsconfeu-led` is the name of our Function App as it appears in Azure.
  - `--storage-account jsconfeustorage` connects the Function App to the Storage account that we created.
  - `--runtime node` tells the Function App that it's going to be a JavaScript Function App.
- Finally, run: `func azure functionapp publish jsconfeu-led`
  - Here, we're using the `func` CLI to publish to a Function App called `jsconfeu-led`, which is what we named the Function App we created in the previous step.

#### Building Infrastructure and Deploying from VS Code

With this directory open, you're going to want to start the function (Run `func start` in your terminal or press`F5`
